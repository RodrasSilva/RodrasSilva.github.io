It’s been a while since I last wrote here, but I felt it was the perfect time to come back and share some of the experiences and lessons I’ve gathered over the past few years. For the last three years, I’ve been working as a backend developer at [Sky](https://www.linkedin.com/company/skyportugal/posts/?feedView=all), learning and growing every single day — and I can’t wait to share some of those insights with you.

I have always loved teaching. There’s something deeply fulfilling about taking knowledge I’ve worked hard to acquire and presenting it in a way that makes it easier for someone else to understand. So when the opportunity to be a mentor in a summer internship came along, I didn’t think twice.

I had the privilege of serving as a summer internship mentor for two consecutive years, in 2024 and 2025. But before sharing that experience, let’s go back a few years.

## From Internship to Full-Time at Sky

It’s 2021, and I have just completed my first year of a master’s degree at IST (Instituto Superior Técnico). During the summer, students could either apply for an internship or simply wait for classes to resume.

Opportunities for summer internships were limited, but fortunately, my university hosted a tech fair where companies came to present themselves to students. That’s where I first met Sky. Applying for their internship was a no-brainer — I had already heard so many good things about the company from friends and professors.

Two months later, my internship was over. Sky offered me a job, but I asked for a year to finish my degree.

I officially joined Sky in September 2022 and have been there ever since.

In 2024, during one of my 1:1 meetings with my manager, I was asked if I’d be interested in mentoring two interns for the summer. I immediately said yes — and that’s where this part of the story begins.

## Stepping into Mentorship - Summer 2024

In 2024, I was still part of my first team at Sky, working on a system that processed and returned images with various operations — resizing, cropping, composition, and more. At the time, our internship project focused on building a large language model (LLM) capable of answering support queries related to the system we developed.

Before the internship began, I was tasked with creating onboarding documentation for the interns. This included:

- **An installation guide** with step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring all necessary applications.
- **A project page** describing the problem to be solved and providing tips to help them achieve the desired goal.

I mentored two interns over the course of two months. This involved:

- **Daily stand-ups** to discuss progress and challenges.
- **1:1 meetings** to check in on how they were feeling about the internship experience.
- **Bi-weekly planning sessions** to align on the tasks for the upcoming weeks. 

One of the most important lessons I learned was understanding the interns’ needs. Do they require a lot of support? Are they capable of understanding the project and collaborating effectively? This isn’t something you can plan ahead of time — it depends entirely on the people you’re mentoring.

As a mentor, you need to adapt your schedule to meet their needs without hindering their growth. It’s a delicate balance: giving them enough space to figure out solutions on their own while ensuring they know you’re available whenever they get stuck.

You also need to keep the project roadmap in mind. Two months is not a long time, especially for projects that involve significant technical work, so proper planning is essential.

When the project was finally delivered and presented to other teams, I felt a wave of relief — everything had gone smoothly, and the interns did an excellent job.

## Building on Experience: Summer 2025
One year later, it’s May 2025, and I’m once again given the opportunity to mentor summer interns. By this time, I had moved to a different team within my department, working on a completely new system.

This year, the first challenge was deciding on a project for the interns. It needed to strike a delicate balance — something useful, achievable within two months, and with the potential to actually go live. Many internship projects never reach production because they’re either not mature enough or companies simply don’t have the resources to refine and maintain them.

Fortunately, our team had been developing a support tool for our system over the past few years, and I identified a specific part that could be improved to add more functionality. I focused on clarifying what could be built and created a detailed requirements document to guide the interns’ work.

Just like the previous year, I also prepared onboarding documentation to help the interns quickly set up their development environment.

When the internship began, we welcomed two interns once again. This time, I felt far more confident in my role as a mentor, thanks to the experience I had gained the previous summer. My manager worked with me to plan a clear two-month roadmap, dividing tasks and deliverables so that everyone knew what to expect.

I’d love to say everything went exactly according to plan — but that wouldn’t be true.

Halfway through the internship, one of the interns had an injury and was unable to work for nearly three weeks. Three weeks might not sound like much, but it’s nearly half of the entire internship period. This forced us to revisit the roadmap and re-evaluate priorities.

Fortunately, our other intern completed his work ahead of schedule and was able to take on some of the additional tasks. When the injured intern returned, he jumped back in, completed the feature he was working on, and prepared the final presentation for the company.

In the end, the internship was a success. Despite the unexpected challenges, we achieved our goals and delivered everything on time — an experience that once again reminded me of the importance of adaptability and teamwork.

## Conclusion

A summer internship is always a bittersweet experience. On one hand, you get to work on an exciting project alongside interns who are eager to learn, while you yourself grow as a mentor — learning to guide, support, and sometimes even manage a small team. On the other hand, two months fly by far too quickly. Just as you start to hit your stride and think of new ideas to improve the project, it’s already time to wrap up.

Looking back, I can clearly see how each year taught me something different:

- **2024 taught me empathy and adaptability.** I learned how to read the needs of my interns, balance giving them autonomy with offering timely support, and keep the roadmap realistic in a very short time frame.
- **2025 taught me resilience and prioritization.** When unexpected challenges appeared, I had to re-evaluate the plan, redistribute work, and make sure we still delivered something meaningful. It was a powerful lesson in flexibility, communication, and teamwork under pressure.

If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend applying for a summer internship. It’s one of the best ways to gain real hands-on experience while you’re still in university, and it can open doors you didn’t even know were there.

As for me, mentoring remains one of the most rewarding parts of my career. Each year, I gain new skills — not just as a developer, but as a leader, and I can’t wait to see what the next mentorship opportunity will teach me.
