# Rodrigo Silva's Portfolio

This repository hosts the personal portfolio website for Rodrigo Silva. It is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages, based on the "Strata" design by HTML5 UP.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

- **`index.html`**
  The main entry point of the website. This single file contains all the HTML markup for the site, including the "About Me" section, "Publications", and contact information.

- **`assets/`**
  Contains all the static assets and styling logic:
  - **`css/`**: Compiled stylesheets (e.g., `main.css`) used by the browser.
  - **`sass/`**: Source Sass files (`.scss`) where styles are defined before being compiled to CSS.
  - **`js/`**: JavaScript files for site interactivity (includes jQuery and utility scripts).
  - **`webfonts/`**: Font files (e.g., Font Awesome) used for icons.

- **`images/`**
  Stores static images used on the site, such as profile pictures and background assets.

- **`_config.yml`**
  Configuration file for Jekyll (GitHub Pages' static site generator).

- **`posts/`**
  Reserved for blog posts (currently unused).

## Customization

- **Content**: Edit `index.html` to update text, links, and sections.
- **Styling**: Modify the files in `assets/sass/` for structural style changes, or `assets/css/main.css` for quick overrides.
